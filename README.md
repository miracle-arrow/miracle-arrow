I am a seasoned full stack developer and self-motivated software engineer.
I'm a tech enthusiast with experience in a wide range of fields and languages including JavaScript, Python, C#, PHP and Go.
Love bringing innovation to any team or company to put them ahead of the curve. I worked with front-end (React, React Native, Angular, Vue.js, Webpack, ...), back-end (Node, Python, C#, Go, MySQL, MongoDB, Serverless ...), and Amazon Web Services. 
Built CI/CD using Circle CI, Travis CI, and Docker. 
Developed a lot of websites and mobile apps including hotel management system (including mobile app), learning management system, and video editors. Have perfect skills with Twilio and Node Red. I believe that touching so many different technologies helps me having a pragmatic approach in going from a simple vision to a tangible product. If you have a vision in mind, no matter how crazy you think it is, feel free to reach out and I might be able to help you bring it to life!
